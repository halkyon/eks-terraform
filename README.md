# Managed Kubernetes examples

## What is this?

We'll take a bunch of different cloud provider's managed Kubernetes offering for a spin,
using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create a cluster within it's own network, using best practises
(e.g. private notes, subnets etc) as much as possible.
